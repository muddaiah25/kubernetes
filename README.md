# kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.

It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".

It works with a range of container tools, including Docker, since its first release.
