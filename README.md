# kubernetes

Kubernetes (commonly stylized as K8s[3]) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.[4] It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".

It works with a range of container tools, including Docker, since its first release.
